  A personal offline AI assistant built with Python (v1, v2, and now v3).
  > `Status: Ongoing` – now adding new features & planning voice + visual AI layer.

### 💡 Skills
- Python (pyttsx3, speech_recognition)
- AI experiments & scripting
- GitHub for open sharing

### 🎯 Goals

- Build my own AI system with deep control
- Turn my ideas into real tools
